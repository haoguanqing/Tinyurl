# Tinyurl - Django/PostgreSQL

This is a small web app which shortens any long url into a tiny url. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) was used locally to build and maintain a virtual development environment (see [here](https://github.com/haoguanqing/tinyurl-vagrant-env) for the Vagrantfile).

The app is currently deployed on [Heroku](https://hgq-twttr.herokuapp.com/).
